# Model Identification of Neural Encoding (MINE) ðŸ§ ðŸ’»

This program allows users to use MINE to train a flexible convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze experimental datasets containing neural activity and corresponding predictors (e.g., behavioral responses).

# Quick Start

[1] Create an environment using Python v3.9

```bash
conda create -n mine python=3.9
```

[2] Activate new environment

```bash
conda activate mine
```

[3] Install MINE from PyPi

```bash
pip install neuro_mine
```

[4] Run program

```bash
Mine
```

[5] Follow dialog prompts to select predictors and response .csv files. These files must have the following structure:
<br>- .csv file format
<br>- Predictor data **must** have time as the first column and it must be named 'time'; for optimal outputs, predictor columns should be meaningfully labelled (e.g., 'temperature' or 'left_paw') in the header
<br>- Reponse data **must** have time as the first column and the responses must be in adjacent columns; column titles (a header) are supported but are not mandatory

*Application:*
<br>- Any model organism
<br>- Any type of predictor data (stimuli and/or behavior)
<br>- Any type of response data (imaging or spikes)


*Limitation:*
<br>- Data must be continuous in time, and time must be monotonically increasing (i.e., any discontinuity between epochs must be resolved prior to fitting)
